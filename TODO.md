- [ ] implement the optimal algorithm instead of SA-IS
- [ ] dynamically set the block-size (currently fixed at 256, for char) and consequently fix for longer strings
- [ ] use Shiloach's Fast Canonization Algorithm instead of Booth's
- [ ] find a better algorithm that identifies periodic words
- [ ] replace "string" with C-style char arrays (char*)
- [ ] better testing
